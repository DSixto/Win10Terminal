# Win10Terminal
Win10 Terminal Configuration Files

Felt like playing with Windows 10 subsystem for linux.
After not being able to easily import my vim and terminal settings from my Macbook I decided to mannually add the files then later on create a script for faster install.

If you wish to install Vim along with the plugins I currently have then: 
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim    
Then download the .vimrc file 
Install from the command: vim +PluginInstall +qall on Terminal

//More insturctions to come.
